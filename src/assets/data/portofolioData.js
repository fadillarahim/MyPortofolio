      "Developed a comprehensive web application using React and Express for **Kalbe International** to streamline the tracking of Year-To-Date (YTD) data across performance indicators assigned to various lines of business (LOB) and departments. The CLA Online application significantly enhances the transparency of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) through automated document creation, approval workflows, and reporting functionalities, offering real-time insights into organizational growth and performance achievements. </br> Previously, the Commitment Letter Agreement (CLA) process was manually managed using Excel spreadsheets and stored on Google Drive, which posed significant challenges. This outdated method made data retrieval cumbersome and increased the risks of data loss and mismanagement. Moreover, the transparency of KPI calculations, growth metrics, and achievements was limited, with rigid permission settings that failed to keep certain CLA indicators confidential among involved parties. </br> The CLA Online application addresses these challenges by automating business processes for the Management System division, transforming a previously cumbersome manual workflow into an efficient digital solution. The development of CLA Online presented unique challenges due to its complex business processes and the diverse nature of data types involved, including quantitative, qualitative, and hybrid data types. Additionally, the application handles various achievement and growth calculations, determining whether indicators represent maximum or minimum expected values. Based on these metrics, the system decides if users need to input a Success Indicator (SIRA) for successful evaluations or a Failure Indicator (PICAPA) for unmet targets",

      "Designed and implemented a robust financial management system to optimize ERP access cycles for monthly data closures, facilitating seamless connectivity between SQL Server and SAP SQL Anywhere via ODBC. This application enhances user management by business unit and secures ERP access globally, significantly improving data closure processes.</br>Within Kalbe International, the assignment of users in the OrlanSoft ERP system is currently performed manually by the IT admin team for each reporting period. The IT admin is responsible for individually entering each user who will act as the person in charge (PIC) of inputting closing data for every period within the OrlanSoft application. This task encompasses not only the head office but also PICs across all Strategic Business Units (SBUs) worldwide (e.g., Philippines, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, etc.), creating a considerable pain point given the admin's additional responsibilities.</br>ALFA emerges as a strategic solution to this issue, providing a streamlined process for assigning users that eliminates the need to go through the OrlanSoft ERP. Instead, assignments can now be managed directly through ALFA, alleviating concerns regarding the transfer of responsibilities from the IT team to the Finance division. A standout feature of ALFA is the <br>User Grouping</br> functionality, which allows for bulk user assignments, thus optimizing the assignment process.</br>The development of ALFA presented challenges related to data insertion into the ERP database, which operates on SAP SQL Anywhere, while the web application utilizes Microsoft SQL Server. This challenge was effectively addressed through the implementation of Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) technology, ensuring smooth data integration between the two systems.",

Travel requires careful financial management and authorization from various stakeholders. Prior to implementing the Travel Request system, travel expense requests and approvals were managed manually, often using Excel spreadsheets, resulting in inflexible data management that was difficult to access and lacked transparency.</br>The Travel Request application serves as a solution to automate these processes comprehensively. Functioning as a mini-ERP, it encompasses multiple phases, starting with the creation of travel proposals that detail the requestorâ€™s information and the trip itinerary, including required expenses such as airfare, accommodation, and meals. Expenses can be requested in multiple currencies (USD and local currency), streamlining the approval process by relevant authorities in the target travel destinations.</br>The application also manages the disbursement process for travel funding, featuring three submenus: payment requests for travel expenses, reimbursements for excess payments, and management of funds not utilized (full refunds). This menu is accessible solely to cashiers and generates automatic journal entries in the Orlansoft ERP system.</br>Finally, the settlement process allows the traveler to report on their expenses against the funds provided by the company. This reporting process includes a chart of accounts (COA) and automatically creates journal entries in the ERP system, ensuring accurate financial tracking and reporting.",

      "In 2019, nearly a billion people worldwide were living with mental health disorders, with depression and anxiety being the most prevalent, according to the World Health Organization. Limited access to mental health consultation services has contributed to this alarming statistic. MindsCare was created as a solution to bridge this gap, offering **MindsBot** as a primary featureâ€”a mental health chatbot powered by Natural Language Generation, built on the advanced Transformer Architecture using the GPT-2 XL Large Language Model (LLM).</br>MindsCare was developed as my final research project for completing my Bachelorâ€™s degree at Politeknik Negeri Jakarta. Itâ€™s a web-based platform built with ReactJS and Flask, designed to provide accessible mental health support through conversational AI.</br>The chatbot model was created through hyperparameter tuning on GPT-2, trained on a dataset containing question-and-answer pairs related to mental health issues. This model was integrated into a web application, achieving a Word Perplexity score of 1.167, indicating a high-quality text generation capability. The chatbotâ€™s validity was assessed through human evaluation by mental health experts, achieving an 82.5% validity score. Reliability testing, using Cohen's Kappa, yielded a coefficient of 0.4667, categorizing it as having moderate agreement. Functional system tests through Black Box Testing demonstrated a 100% success rate for positive scenarios. However, in negative scenarios, the chatbot currently lacks the capability to restrict inputs outside of mental health contexts.</br>MindsCare represents a significant step towards making mental health support more accessible, leveraging advanced AI to address one of the worldâ€™s most pressing health challenges.",
